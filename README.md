=====================

Hello World!

My name is Jonathan Ward, and I plan on becoming an Engineer in Coding
so that I can develop my own video games one day. 

I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my time in TechBootcampHQ 
during my Summer2021 semester, and was able to create my own portfolio page as
well as a few games of my own as my projects for the class!

I hope I'll be able to work in game engines like Unity one day...
